# PlaygroundCoreDotNet
This is a playground for .net core application development combined with free continuous integration services like [appveyor](http://appveyor.com), [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/), and [sonarqube](https://about.sonarcloud.io/).

## TODO's
- [x] Setup [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Add develop branch and make this the default branch in GitHub.
- [ ] simple .net core / standard project with unittests
- [ ] Use Appveyor
- [ ] Use Travis
- [ ] Use SonarQube
- [ ] Extend project with Typescript, npm etc.
- [ ] [GitVersion](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automatic versioning.
